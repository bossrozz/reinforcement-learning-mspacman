# reinforcement-learning-mspacman

This repository contains a simple Reinforcement Learning Agent for the Ms. PacMan ATARI Game in OpenAI Gym. It aims to provide a good introductory overview of what RL can achieve in the gaming space and help users understand how an AI learns and adapts.

To use the agent, you can download the "Final_Individual_Project_RL_Rozz_Banquerigo.ipynb" file and run it in your conda environment. Ensure that all the required libraries are installed, and it should work as expected.
